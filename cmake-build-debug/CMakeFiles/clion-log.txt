CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:35 (link_directories):
  This command specifies the relative path

    usr/lib

  as a link directory.

  Policy CMP0015 is not set: link_directories() treats paths relative to the
  source dir.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0015" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:41 (TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES):
  Policy CMP0023 is not set: Plain and keyword target_link_libraries
  signatures cannot be mixed.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0023" for policy
  details.  Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this
  warning.

  The plain signature for target_link_libraries has already been used with
  the target "vss-simulator".  All uses of target_link_libraries with a
  target should be either all-keyword or all-plain.

  The uses of the plain signature are here:

   * CMakeLists.txt:40 (TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES)

This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
